## Description
This is an API for a social network that uses a NoSQL database so that it can handle large amounts of unstructured data and allow users to share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Installation
npm install

## Usage
When ready to run, type node server in the terminal to get port listening. Because there is no front end code you will need to use something like Insomnia to try out the routes. This application is using PORT 3003. In insomnia you will be able to get ALL users, get a user by ID, create a new user, update a user by ID as well as delete a user. You will be able to get all these though the thoughts route as well. You'll be able to connect users by ID by adding (and deleting) them as friends. You will also be able to add and delete reactions to thoughts.
